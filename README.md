## Introduction
The card editor app allows users to customize and design cards with ease. It offers various features to modify the card's appearance, including changing the background image, adjusting the content, altering the call-to-action (CTA), and selecting different background colors using a color picker tool.

One of the key functionalities of the app is the ability to upload external image files to serve as the background of the card. Users can simply upload an image file from their device, and the app will seamlessly integrate it into the card's design.

Moreover, users have full control over the content displayed on the card. They can edit the text content, adjust the font size, change the alignment, and even specify the maximum number of characters per line to ensure optimal readability.

The app also provides options to customize the CTA button, allowing users to set the text, position, and color of the button to suit their preferences. This enables users to create compelling calls-to-action that encourage interaction and engagement.

In addition to content customization, the app offers a color picker tool that enables users to select and apply various background colors to the card. This feature empowers users to experiment with different color schemes and create visually appealing designs effortlessly.

Overall, the card editor app provides a user-friendly interface and comprehensive customization options, making it ideal for designing a wide range of cards for various purposes, such as invitations, announcements, promotions, and more. With its intuitive controls and versatile features, users can unleash their creativity and design stunning cards tailored to their needs.
